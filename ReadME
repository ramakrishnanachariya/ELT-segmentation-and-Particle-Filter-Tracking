	Actually i try to implement this two paper work
	------------------------------------------------ 
1.Simple face detection and bitmasking with other imageMoving Object Segmentation using Enhanced
Laplacian Thresholding Method for Video Surveillance

2.Specified Object Tracking Problem in an Environment of Multiple Moving(Particle Filter)
	
S/W  Requirement 
=================
OpenCV 2.4.9
	

How to execute the program
==========================
goto src floder , then

important 
*********
1.blob based object detect u can adjust blob size based on ur video 
2.while running this program this mark ur object to track using mouse click

g++ *.cpp -o Particle_Filter `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
./Particle_Filter
